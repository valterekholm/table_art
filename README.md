HTML and Javascript table as decoration
This file drenders a HTML table where the cells are of different shapes. A diagonal row is of cells of cirkular shape
and cells become thinner the further away they are from this diagonal row.
I made this while thinking of how to have a formula for a vertical line and meassuring offset in a diagonal direction.
The html format was choosen to allow broad compability.
